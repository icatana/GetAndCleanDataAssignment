# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Content
The content of this repository is : 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

## Description
This project it concerns one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now, and this is wearable computing - see for example [this article] (http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from this project represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
