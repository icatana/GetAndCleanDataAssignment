# Code Book - Getting And Cleaning Data

## Objective
This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data from the original data set described here below.

## Data Set and Variables

### Source Reference

### Details
This data set concerns the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset project, described here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The Smartlab has developed a new publicly available database of daily human activities that has been recorded using accelerometer and gyroscope data from a waist-mounted Android-OS smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II). The six studied activities are: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying down.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

#### For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
